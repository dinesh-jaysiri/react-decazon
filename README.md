This is built on the Ethereum blockchain using Solidity smart contracts. The platform allows users to list products for sale and buy products from other users using cryptocurrency.

The backend smart contract handles the listing and buying of products. Sellers can list products by calling the list function with the required parameters, such as the product ID, name, category, image, cost, rating, and stock. Once listed, buyers can purchase products by calling the buy function with the ID of the product they want to purchase and sending the required amount of cryptocurrency.

The smart contract also keeps track of orders by storing them in a mapping indexed by the buyer's address and order ID. The withdraw function allows the contract owner to withdraw any cryptocurrency held by the contract.

The front end of the platform is built using React, Metamask, and Ether.js. Users can connect their Metamask wallets to the platform to interact with the smart contract and make purchases.

Overall, Decazon provides a decentralized alternative to traditional e-commerce platforms, allowing users to buy and sell products without the need for intermediaries or central authorities.

### Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
